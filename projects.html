                    <p>This was a group project during my university days, and I was the programmer. I am still exploring new ways and designs while creating this.

                        Although this is not my account that was used to upload the project—since we were still new to GitHub at that time—we shared our work via ZIP files. I was the main programmer and created all the templates for this website.
